## Installation

```bash
# Yarn
yarn add dnd-email-editor

# NPM
npm install dnd-email-editor

```

## What's included

Editor includes these api's

- `getHtml` - export the design as html content
- `getJson` - export as json string, this string can then be used with `loadJson`
- `loadJson` - load an existing design from json string

## Usage

- Importing

```typescript
import Editor from 'dnd-email-editor';

return <Editor />;
```

- Setup a `ref` using `useRef` and pass it to editor

```typescript
const ref = React.useRef(null);

return <Editor ref={ref} />;
```

- Using `getHtml()`, `getJson()` and `loadJson()`

```typescript
const logValues = () => {
  if (ref.current) {
    const html = ref.current.getHtml();
    const json = ref.current.getJson();
    console.log(html, json);
  }
};

const loadJson = (json: string) => {
  if (ref.current) {
    ref.current.loadJson(json);
  }
};
```

- Typescript

Inorder to use typescript and get cool definitions, just pass the type to the ref

```diff
import Editor from 'dnd-email-editor';

const ExampleComponent = () => {

- const ref = useRef(null);
+ const ref = useRef<Editor>(null);

  return (
    <Editor ref={ref}/>
  );

}
```

## Purpose

There are soo many drag and drop editors that helps in **creating website** but **not mails**, because mails differ a lot from `a normal html webpage'

- even if there are `mail editors` available, they are paid and not `open-source`.

One such example would be `unlayer`, It claims to be opensource but its not.

- Looking at their source code, they only provide their loader-script and call it as `open-source`
- later they ask you to pay for its features.

the above reasons and also I was inspired by drag-n-drop editors in general, so I decided to make one.
